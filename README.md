# Description
Claustrophobia, Team R's game project, developped in partial fulfillment of the requirements of COMP376 XX for fall 2018.

**The project was developed and tested with [`Unity`](https://unity3d.com/) 2018.2.17f1.**

# Running
To open the game project, open the source folder at the Unity home screen.
Inside `Assets > Scenes` are two scenes: Menu and Game.
Menu is the main menu of the game and is the starting point of the game.
Game is the scene where the gameplay happens.
Either can be run within the Unity editor.
